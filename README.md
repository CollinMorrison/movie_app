### Navigating the app
This is a simple app that will display search results from IMDB depending on the title of movie that is provided in the search box. Feel free to search any movie you like, but be aware that adult content is filtered out. On each card, you can see the title of the movie, an image of the movie poster, and the rating of each movie based on the votes provided by IMDB. Enjoy!


### Notes regarding my experience with this challenge
I greatly appreciate the opportunity to complete this code challenge. I have never worked with nuxt or express before, so these technologies were new to me. I enjoyed exploring the docs and online examples to get a feel for the frameworks. I used TailwindUI for some of the styling because I'm somewhat familiar with it, and am happy with what I was able to produce in the seemingly short 4hrs I was allotted. I am aware I did not include any unit testing, as mocha is also new to me. Had I had more time, that is what I would've developed next. I also would've fine-tuned the styling on the main page more and added additional functionality, but it works in an MVP sense currently. Thanks again for considering my application, I look forward to hearing back about my code challenge!
